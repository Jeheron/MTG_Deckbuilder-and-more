# MTG_Deckbuilder-and-more
With this project you can search a database for MTG cards and create decks to share with other people. The project will be created with Angular so I can practice it and become a better developer. I love Magic the Gathering and Angular, so this is a dream project. There are a lot of Magic cards so this means that I will need to have a database which holds all the cards, decks and more. At first there will be almost no graphics as to ensure the best coding, and after the project works as it should, graphics will make the deckbuilder look like a piece of art (well, that's the idea...)

The idea is to:
- Search cards by every possible option (eg. color, type, cmc, ...)
- Select cards to add to a deck
- Select cards to add to "interesting cards" which you want to look at later
- see your deck as you choose the cards
- ...

Version 1
- Setting up the project (Hello world... yeah I know)
- Creating the search view with a dummy card list (10 cards) instead of the search window
- clicking on a card to see a popup of the card with details

Version 2
- Getting the service to work so you are able to get data from the MTG API
- Filtering the list of cards by search criteria

Version 3
- Design a deck system
- Be able to do CRUD operations on the decks

Version 4
